	 * Address line test
	 *
	 * Description: Test the address bus wiring in a
	 *              memory region by performing a walking
	 *              1's test on the relevant bits of the
	 *              address and checking for aliasing.
	 *              This test will find single-bit
	 *              address failures such as stuck -high,
	 *              stuck-low, and shorted pins. The base
	 *              address and size of the region are
	 *              selected by the caller.
	 *
	 * Notes:	For best results, the selected base
	 *              address should have enough LSB 0's to
	 *              guarantee single address bit changes.
	 *              For example, to test a 64-Kbyte
	 *              region, select a base address on a
	 *              64-Kbyte boundary. Also, select the
	 *              region size as a power-of-two if at
	 *              all possible.
	 *
	 * ## NOTE ##	Be sure to specify start and end
	 *              addresses such that num_words has
	 *              lots of bits set. For example an
	 *              address range of 01000000 02000000 is
	 *              bad while a range of 01000000
	 *              01ffffff is perfect.
