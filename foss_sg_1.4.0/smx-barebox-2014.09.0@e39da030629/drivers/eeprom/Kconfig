menu "EEPROM support"

config EEPROM_AT25
	tristate "SPI EEPROMs from most vendors"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Enable this driver to get read/write support to most SPI EEPROMs,
	  after you configure the board init code to know about each eeprom
	  on your target board.

config EEPROM_AT24
	bool "at24 based eeprom"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  Enable this driver to get read/write support to most I2C EEPROMs,
	  after you configure the driver to know about each EEPROM on
	  your target board. Use these generic chip names, instead of
	  vendor-specific ones like at24c64 or 24lc02:

	    24c00, 24c01, 24c02, spd (readonly 24c02), 24c04, 24c08,
	    24c16, 24c32, 24c64, 24c128, 24c256, 24c512, 24c1024

	  Unless you like data loss puzzles, always be sure that any chip
	  you configure as a 24c32 (32 kbit) or larger is NOT really a
	  24c16 (16 kbit) or smaller, and vice versa. Marking the chip
	  as read-only won't help recover from this. Also, if your chip
	  has any software write-protect mechanism you may want to review the
	  code to make sure this driver won't turn it on by accident.
