	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will
	  be allowed to plug one or more RTCs to your system. You will
	  probably want to enable one or more of the interfaces below.

	  If you say yes here you get support for various compatible RTC
	  chips (often with battery backup) connected with I2C. This driver
	  should handle DS1307, DS1338 and probably other chips.

	  The first seven registers on these chips hold an RTC, and other
	  registers may add features such as NVRAM, a trickle charger for
	  the RTC/NVRAM backup power, and alarms.
