Subject: [PATCH] Fix "Argument list too long" error

There would be an "Argument list too long" error when the
build directory is longer than 200, this is caused by:

headers=`echo $(PLUGIN_HEADERS) | tr ' ' '\012' | sort -u`

The PLUGIN_HEADERS is too long before sort, so the "echo" can't handle
it, use the $(sort list) of GNU make which can handle the too long list
would fix the problem, the header would be short enough after sorted.
The "tr ' ' '\012'" was used for translating the space to "\n", the
$(sort list) doesn't need this.
