	  Build a squashfs image of the root filesystem. This image can be stored
	  linearly into target's flash device at the start of the desired
	  partition. You should erase the whole partition first if the image
	  is smaller than partition's size. If not, garbage data in the remaining
	  space could confuse the filesystem driver.
