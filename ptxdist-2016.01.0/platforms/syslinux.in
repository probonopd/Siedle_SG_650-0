	  Bootloader for Linux/i386 using MS-DOS floppies

	  SYSLINUX is a boot loader for the Linux/i386 operating
	  system which operates off an MS-DOS/Windows FAT
	  filesystem. It is intended to simplify first-time
	  installation of Linux, and for creation of rescue and other
	  special-purpose boot disks.

	  It can also be used as a PXE bootloader during network boots.

	  SYSLINUX is probably not suitable as a general purpose boot
	  loader. However, SYSLINUX has shown itself to be quite
	  useful in a number of special-purpose applications.
