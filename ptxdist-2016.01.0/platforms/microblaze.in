	  The Xilinx BSP (shortly "xlbsp") is part of a specific OSELAS.BSP()
	  and consits of different automatically generated files from the
	  Xilinx FPGA design. All files for the xlbsp have to be copied from
	  Xilinx FPGA design project into the OSELAS.BSP() platforms directory
	  ${PTXDIST_PLATFORMCONFIGDIR}/platforms/xlbsp. Then make a link in
	  OSELAS.BSP() platforms directory:

		xlbsp_softcpu.in -> xlbsp/Kconfig.auto

	  You have to copy all auto generated files from Xilinx BSP "Third
	  Party OS (TPOS)" to xlbsp in your OSELAS.BSP(). To get TPOS you have
	  to include the EDK user repository from MB-Ref into your Xilinx FPGA
	  design flow.
