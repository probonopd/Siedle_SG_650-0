	  This is a Portable Transport Relay Translator Daemon (pTRTd)
	  as specified by RFC 3142 (tcp, udp)

	  Beware: This is rather old voodoo, last upstream update was
	  in 2002. This ptxdist package ist provided primarily for
	  test environments, ipv6 transition planing, etc.

	  DO NOT USE PTRTD EXCEPT IN AN ISOLATED NETWORK.
