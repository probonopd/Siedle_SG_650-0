	  Libmd is a cryptographic message digest library. It implements these
	  message digest algorithms:
	    MD2 (RFC 1319 - B. Kaliski)
	    MD4 (RFC 1186 - R. Rivest)
	    MD5 (RFC 1321 - R. Rivest)
	    SHA-1 (FIPS PUB 180 and 180.1 - NIST)
	    RIPEMD-160 (http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~bosselae/ripemd160.html)
	  It could be used by the upcoming new Xorg server if you don't want
	  the openssl package on your target. If there is already openssl
	  present, the Xorg server can use the SHA-1 from the openssl library
	  instead.

config LIBMD_STATIC
	bool
	prompt "build static only"
	help
	  Build a static only version of this library. This makes sense if only
	  one program will use this library on the target and it makes more
	  sense if a CPU with low register count (like x86) is in use.

config LIBMD_DEBUG
	bool
	prompt "enable debug support"
	help
	  Build the library with debug support.
