	  This library is the X Font Library 2.x. (previous versions are called
	  X Freetype Library). It supports client-side font rendering so it draws
	  fonts independend from the X server side. The X server should support
	  the X render extension to speed up rendering on the server side. Without
	  this extension on X server side rendering will be very slow.
	  The Xft library works in combination with the fontconfig and freetype2
	  libraries to provide an interface for applications to draw anti-aliased
	  text.
