	  OpenVPN is an application to securely tunnel IP networks
	  over a single UDP or TCP port. It can be used to access
	  remote sites, make secure point-to-point connections,
	  enhance wireless security, etc.


	  OpenVPN uses all of the encryption, authentication, and
	  certification features provided by the OpenSSL library (any
	  cipher, key size, or HMAC digest).

	  OpenVPN may use static, pre-shared keys or TLS-based dynamic
	  key exchange. It also supports VPNs with dynamic endpoints
	  (DHCP or dial-up clients), tunnels over NAT or
	  connection-oriented stateful firewalls (such as Linux's
	  iptables).
