	  libpipeline is a C library for setting up and running pipelines of
	  processes, without needing to involve shell command-line parsing which
	  is often error-prone and insecure. This alleviates programmers of the
	  need to laboriously construct pipelines using lower-level primitives
	  such as fork and execve.

	  Use socketpair(2) as fast replacement for pipe(2)
