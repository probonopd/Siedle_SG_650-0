	  libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
	  It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
	  as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
	  on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.
