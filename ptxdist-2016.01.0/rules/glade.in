	  Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick and easy development of
	  user interfaces for the GTK+ 2 toolkit. It also contains
	  built-in support for generating the C source code needed to
	  recreate the interfaces.
	  The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in the
	  well-known XML format, enabling easy integration with
	  external tools. Several tools are already available which
	  can turn the XML files into source code in other languages
	  such as C++, Perl and Python. Other tools such as libglade
	  can load the XML files and create the interfaces at runtime.
