	  modular assembler with multiple syntaxes support

	  Yasm is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler. It
	  supports multiple assembler syntaxes (eg, NASM, GAS, etc.)
	  in addition to multiple output object formats (binary
	  objects, COFF, Win32, ELF32, ELF64) and even multiple
	  instruction sets (including AMD64). It also has an optimiser
	  module.
