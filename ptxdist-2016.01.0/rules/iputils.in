	help
	  The ping command uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram
	  to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway. ECHO_REQUEST
	  datagrams pings have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a struct
	  timeval and then an arbitrary number of pad bytes used to fill out
	  the packet.

	  The ping6 command is IPv6 version of ping, and can also send Node
	  Information Queries (RFC4620). Intermediate hops may not be allowed,
	  because IPv6 source routing was deprecated (RFC5095).

	  Listens RARP (http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc903.txt) requests from
	  clients. Provided MAC address of client is found in /etc/ethers
	  database and obtained host name is resolvable to an IP address
	  appropriate for attached network, rarpd answers to client with
	  RARPD reply carrying an IP address.

config IPUTILS_RDISC

	  The rdisc command implements client side of the ICMP router discover
	  protocol. rdisc is invoked at boot time to populate the network
	  routing tables with default routes.
