	  This is the GNU termcap library -- a library of C functions that
	  enable programs to send control strings to terminals in a way
	  independent of the terminal type.  The GNU termcap library does not
	  place an arbitrary limit on the size of termcap entries, unlike most
	  other termcap libraries.
	  This is a static library only.

	  This installs the latest official termcap data file into /etc/termcap.src.

	  The current version contains some entries that are more than 1023 bytes
	  long, which is the largest value that is safe to use with the many
	  historical applications that only allocate a 1024 byte termcap buffer
	  (telnet, for example). If you make sure that all of your programs
	  allocate buffers of at least 2500 bytes, or let the termcap library do
	  it by passing a NULL pointer, then it is safe to install the new
	  termcap file.
	  To handle different terminal capabilities this database is needed by
	  applications on the target.
