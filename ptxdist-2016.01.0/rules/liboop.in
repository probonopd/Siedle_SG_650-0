	  Liboop provides a generic, callback-based event dispatch
	  interface, and aims to ease the development of multiplexed,
	  non-blocking, event-driven modular applications, components,
	  and libraries under POSIX-based operating systems. It
	  includes adapters for select(), poll(), the glib event loop,
	  the TCL event loop, the W3C libwww, asynchronous DNS, and
	  GNU readline.
