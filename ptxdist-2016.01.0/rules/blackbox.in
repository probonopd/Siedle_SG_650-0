	  The Debian Project describes Blackbox like this:

	  This is a window manager for X.  It is similar in many respects to
	  such popular packages as Window Maker, Enlightenment, and FVWM2.
	  You might be interested in this package if you are tired of window
	  managers that are a heavy drain on your system resources, but you
	  still want an attractive and modern-looking interface. [...]

	  Written in c++
