	  This is libConfuse, a library for parsing configuration files. It was
	  called libcfg before, but was changed to not confuse with other
	  similar libraries.

	  There is a project page at http://sv.nongnu.org/projects/confuse.
	  Report bugs to <confuse-devel@nongnu.org>

config LIBCONFUSE_STATIC
	bool
	depends on LIBCONFUSE
	prompt "build static only"
	help
	  Build a static only version of this library. This makes sense if only
	  one program will use this library on the target and it makes more
	  sense if a CPU with low register count (like x86) is in use.
