config UCLIBC_C
	bool

	help
	  Any Unix-like operating system needs a C library:
	  the library which defines the "system calls" and
	  other basic facilities such as open, malloc, printf,
	  exit...

	  The uClibc library is used as the C library in the
	  GNU system and embedded systems with the Linux kernel.

	  Better not turn this option off..
