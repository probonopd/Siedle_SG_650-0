	help
	  This feature contains a collection of programs that are
	  linked against klibc. These duplicate some of the
	  functionality of a regular Linux toolset, but are typically
	  much smaller than their full-function counterparts. They are
	  intended for inclusion in initramfs images and can do the
	  network configuration outside the kernel and someting
	  special before mounting the final root filesystem.

choice
	prompt "link klibc programs"
	help
	  You can select how to link the klibc programs.

	  There are two possibilities, either links shared or
	  static. When linking statically the klibc is linked into
	  each program. Select this if you only have a few
	  programs. On the other hand if you have many tools a
	  dynamically linked klibc saves some space.
