	  ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command
	  until it exits.  While the command is executing, ltrace
	  intercepts and records the dynamic library calls which are
	  called by the executed process and the signals received by
	  that process. It can also intercept and print the system
	  calls executed by the program.
