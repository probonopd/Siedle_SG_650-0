	  Bootchart allows you to audit the boot sequence of your
	  computer and generate a pretty chart of the processes run,
	  including how long they took and how much CPU and I/O they
	  used.

	  The auditing is performed by adding a script to the top of
	  your initramfs which lives inside is own tiny filesystem
	  during the boot process and monitors the rest of the system
	  booting
