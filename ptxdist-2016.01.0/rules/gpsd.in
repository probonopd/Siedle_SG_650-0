	  gpsd is a daemon that listens to a GPS or Loran receiver
	  and translates the positional data into a simplified format
	  that can be more easily used by other programs, like chart plotters.
	  The package comes with a sample client that plots the location
	  of the currently visible GPS satellites (if available)
	  and a speedometer. It can also use DGPS/ip.

	config GPSD_GPSD
		bool
		prompt "gpsd"
		help
		  gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more
		  GPS- or AIS receivers attached through serial or USB
		  ports, making all data on the location/course/velocity
		  of the sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947
		  of the host. With gpsd, multiple location-aware client
		  applications can share access to receivers without
		  contention or loss of data. Also, gpsd responds to
		  queries with a format that is substantially easier to
		  parse than the NMEA 0183 emitted by most GPS receivers.

	config GPSD_GPSCTL
		bool
		prompt "gpsctl"
		help
		  The gpsctl tool for tweaking GPS settings.
		  gpsctl can switch a dual-mode GPS between NMEA and
		  vendor-binary modes. It can also be used to set the
		  device baudrate. Note: Not all devices have these
		  capabilities.

	config GPSD_GPSPIPE
		bool
		prompt "gpspipe"
		help
		  A simple client that captures GPS output and/or gpsd
		  reports and sends it to standard output.
		  gpspipe is a tool to connect to gpsd and output the
		  received sentences to stdout. This makes the program
		  useful as a pipe from gpsd to another program or file.

	config GPSD_GPSFLASH
		bool
		prompt "gpsflash"
		help
		  This program is a firmware loader for GPS receivers
		  connected via serial or USB port. Presently it supports
		  only SiRF GPSes.

	config GPSD_GPXLOGGER
		bool
		prompt "gpxlogger"
		help
		  This program listens to DBUS broadcasts from gpsd
		  (org.gpsd.fix) and logs each fix to standard output as
		  they arrive in an XML format.

	config GPSD_CGPS
		bool
		prompt "cgps"
		help
		  cgps is a client resembling xgps, but without the
		  pictorial satellite display and able to run on a serial
		  terminal or terminal emulator.

	config GPSD_GPSMON
		bool
		prompt "gpsmon"
		select NCURSES
		help
		  The gpsmon real-time packet monitor and diagnostic tool.
		  (This replaces the sirfmon tool in older versions.)
		  gpsmon is a monitor that watches packets coming from a
		  GPS and displays them along with diagnostic information.
		  It supports commands that can be used to tweak GPS settings
		  in various ways; some are device-independent, some vary
		  with the GPS chipset type.

	config GPSD_GPSDECODE
		bool
		depends on GPSD_DRIVER_RTCM104V2
		prompt "gpsdecode"
		help
		  The gpsdecode packet decoder.
		  This tool is a batch-mode decoder for NMEA and various
		  binary packet formats associated with GPS, AIS, and
		  differential-correction services.

	config GPSD_GPSCAT
		bool "gpscat"
		select GPSD_PYTHON
		help
		  The gpscat tool dumps output from a serial device.
		  Optionally, it can packetize the data.
		  gpscat is a simple program for logging and packetizing
		  GPS data streams. It takes input from a specified file
		  or serial device (presumed to have a GPS attached) and
		  reports to standard output.

	config GPSD_GPSFAKE
		bool "gpsfake"
		select GPSD_PYTHON
		help
		  The gpsfake test harness simulating a GPS receiver.
		  gpsfake is a test harness for gpsd and its clients. It
		  opens a pty (pseudo-TTY), launches a gpsd instance that
		  thinks the slave side of the pty is its GPS device, and
		  repeatedly feeds the contents of one or more test logfiles
		  through the master side to the GPS.

	config GPSD_GPSPROF
		bool "gpsprof"
		select GPSD_PYTHON
		help
		  The gpsprof program for plotting spatial scatter of fixes
		  and fix latency.
		  gpsprof measures the various latencies between a GPS and
		  its client. It emits to standard output a GNUPLOT program
		  that draws an illustrative graph. It can also be told to
		  emit the raw profile data.
