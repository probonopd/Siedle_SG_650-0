	  MPEG audio decoder library

	  MAD is an MPEG audio decoder. It currently only supports the
	  MPEG 1 standard, but fully implements all three audio layers
	  (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III, the latter often
	  colloquially known as MP3.)

	  MAD has the following special features:
	  * 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
	  * completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC 11172-3 standard
	  * distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
