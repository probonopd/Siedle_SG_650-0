	  The X Composite extension adds support for translucent windows and
	  non-rectangular windows with anti-aliased edges to the X window
	  system. It also makes the content of obscured windows available to
	  for example desktop pagers, and provides backing store which
	  eliminates flicker. It also makes it possible for a composition
	  manager to draw dynamic effects on the screen, such as window drop
	  shadows.
