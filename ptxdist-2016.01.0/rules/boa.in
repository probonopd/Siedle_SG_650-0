	  Boa is a single-tasking HTTP server. That means that
	  unlike traditional web servers, it does not fork for
	  each incoming connection, nor does it fork many copies
	  of itself to handle multiple connections. It internally
	  multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP connections, and
	  forks only for CGI programs (which must be separate
	  processes), automatic directory generation, and
	  automatic file gunzipping.
