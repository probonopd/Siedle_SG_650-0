                   lib@name@ - The @NAME@ library
                   ------------------------------------

    Overview

    <tell something about this library>

    License
    -------

    <define the license of this library>; see the file COPYING for the
    actual terms.

    Configure options
    -----------------

    Here is a list of configure options which are sometimes useful
    for installation.

     --enable-debug
                     Make the library more noise and do more runtime checks.
                     This will slow down the library at runtime.

     --enable-profiling
                     Build the library with profiling support.

     --enable-coverage
                     Build the library with coverage support.

     --disable-hide
                     Built the library with all internal symbols visible. The
                     default is to only provide the exported functions to a
                     user. When --enable-debug is given all internal symbols
                     are visible.

    Environment Variables
    ---------------------

    You can overwrite CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS from the environment. But
    keep in mind to not forget to add the "-O2 -g", if you use your own CFLAGS
    settings. Only in the case CFLAGS is unset, configure defaults to "-O2 -g"
