	  Fontconfig is a font configuration and
	  customization library, which does not depend on
	  the X Window System.  It is designed to locate
 	  fonts within the system and select them according
	  to requirements specified by applications.

	  Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor
	  does it impose a particular rasterization library
	  on the application.  The X-specific library 'Xft'
	  uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 	  rasterize fonts.
