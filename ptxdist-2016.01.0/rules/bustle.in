	  Bustle is a tool to chart and provide timing information of
	  D-Bus calls for profiling and debugging purposes. It is
	  intended to replace reading the cryptic output of
	  dbus-monitor. Calls are displayed using Message Sequence
	  Charts, a succinct way of representing entities and
	  interactions over time. It can also output data in Graphviz
	  format.
