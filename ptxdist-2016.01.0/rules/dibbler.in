	  Dibbler is a portable DHCPv6 implementation.
	  It supports stateful (i.e. IPv6 address granting) as well as
	  stateless (i.e. option granting) autoconfiguration for IPv6.

config DIBBLER_SERVER
	bool
	prompt "Install server"
	help
	  The Dibbler server supports both stateful (i.e. IPv6 address
	  granting) as well as stateless (i.e. options granting)
	  auto-configuration modes of the DHCPv6 protocol. Relays are also
	  supported. This package allows IPv6 hosts to be automatically
	  configured on the network.

	help
	  Install the startup script for bbinit.

config DIBBLER_CLIENT
	bool
	prompt "Install client"
	help
	  The Dibbler client supports both stateful (i.e. IPv6 address
	  granting) as well as stateless (i.e. option granting)
	  auto-configuration modes of the DHCPv6 protocol. Besides basic
	  capabilities, it supports various DHCPv6 extensions, for instance
	  option renewal. Installing Dibbler allows obtaining IPv6 addresses and
	  options from a DHCPv6 server.

config DIBBLER_CLIENT_STARTSCRIPT
	bool
	default y
	prompt "install /etc/init.d/dibbler-client"
	depends on DIBBLER_CLIENT
	help
	  Install the startup script for bbinit.

config DIBBLER_RELAY
	bool
	prompt "Install relay"
	help
	  Relays are used as proxies between servers and clients. Their main
	  advantage is the ability to support multiple remote links using only
	  one server. Installing Dibbler relay allows serving multiple, not
	  physically connected, links with one DHCPv6 server.

config DIBBLER_RELAY_STARTSCRIPT
	bool
	default y
	prompt "install /etc/init.d/dibbler-relay"
	depends on DIBBLER_RELAY
	help
	  Install the startup script for bbinit.
