	  Build a system with iconv support in the C library. iconv
	  provides a set of functions which convert between different
	  encodings.

	  There are different methods how to provide iconv support:
	  glibc has an own implementation and there is libiconv. When
	  activated, ptxdist uses the iconv support from glibc.
