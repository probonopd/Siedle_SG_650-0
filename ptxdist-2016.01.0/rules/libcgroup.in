	  Control Groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets of tasks,
	  and all their future children, into hierarchical groups with specialized
	  behaviour.

	  This library allows applications to manipulate, control, administrate and
	  monitor control groups and the associated controllers.
