	  Some services need a one time initialization when the system starts
	  up the first time after creating and installing the root filesystem.
	  One example is the 'ssh' server, which needs to create a unique key
	  to provide its services.
	  You can add your own 'one time initialization' by adding files to the
	  /etc/rc.once.d/ directory.
