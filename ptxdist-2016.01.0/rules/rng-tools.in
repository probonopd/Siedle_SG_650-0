	  random number generator daemon - seed kernel random from hwrng

	  This daemon feeds data from a random number generator to the kernel's
	  random number entropy pool, after first checking the data to ensure
	  that it is properly random.

	  By default, a hardware rng at /dev/hwrng is used as entropy source.

	  This daemon is part of the rng-tools, which can be found at
	      http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/
	      git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/kernel/rng-tools/rng-tools.git
