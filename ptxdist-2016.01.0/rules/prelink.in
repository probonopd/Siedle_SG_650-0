	  ELF prelinking utility to speed up dynamic linking.  The
	  prelink package contains a utility which modifies ELF shared
	  libraries and executables, so that far fewer relocations
	  need to be resolved at runtime and thus programs come up
	  faster.

	  install a script that will be run on the first boot to
