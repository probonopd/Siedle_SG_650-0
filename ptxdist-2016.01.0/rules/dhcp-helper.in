	  dhcp-helper is a DHCP and BOOTP relay agent. It listens for DHCP and
	  BOOTP broadcasts on directly connected subnets and relays them to DHCP
	  or BOOTP servers elsewhere.  It also relays replies from the remote
	  servers back to partially configured hosts. Once hosts are fully
	  configured they can communicate directly with their servers and no
	  longer need the services of a relay.
