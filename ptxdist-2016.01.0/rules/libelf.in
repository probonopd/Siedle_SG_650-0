	  an ELF object file access library

	  The elf library provides routines to access, and manipulate,
	  Elf object files. It is still not complete, but is required
	  for a number of programs, such as Eli (a state of the art
	  compiler generation system), and Elk (the Extension Language
	  Kit - an implementation of the Scheme programming language.)
